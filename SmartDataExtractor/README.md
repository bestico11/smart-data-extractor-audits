## Overview
Retail audit datasets are often incomplete, inconsistent, or partially missing key information.  
This application addresses these issues by combining:
- Rule-based offline processing
- Online data extraction using Selenium 
- AI-assisted data completion via OpenAI
- Optional manual correction through a graphical interface
All operations are performed through a **Windows GUI**, making the tool accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## FAQ
### *How to know the format header of input file?*
- After initiating the database file,  
With empty file name and sheet name click on "Run Import"  
An empty file with samples, will be created in SmartDataExtractor\  
You can see the input format.  
Then "Run Import" with its file name and sheet name to add it to the database  
"Run Export" and watch the result output.xlsx  
Now Click on each function in the suggested order  
And after each function, "Run Export" , open the output.xlsx and see what happened.
#### *How to export all data in database?*
- After initiating the database file,  
with empty file name and sheet name click on "Run Export"
#### *What should we do for database filling if there is no internet connection?*
- if you gathered data manually and want to apply the changes to database,  
you could easily apply any change by Manipulate Database - Auto Fill  
or save them in the file and then Run Import,  
the new data will be replaced to insert or update database.
#### *Do I need programming knowledge to use this app?*
- No. The GUI is designed for non-technical users.
#### *Can I reuse the same Excel file?*
- Yes. The output file is a completed copy of the input.
#### *Is the data stored permanently?*
- Data is stored locally in a SQLite database until deleted.
